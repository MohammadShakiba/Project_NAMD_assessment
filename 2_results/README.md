# MQC results 


The outputs of the MQC calculations are provided in `outputs.tar.bz2` file and can be extracted using `tar xvf outputs.tar.bz2`. Each file contain two columns, indicating the surface hopping population of the ground (column `1`) and excited state (column `2`), for `420000` steps (rows).

The time is saved in a separate file in `time.txt` in atomic unit. The time step in this project is `5.0 a.u.`.
